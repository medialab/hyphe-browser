## What is this all about?

Hyphe browser is an inquiry companion for qualitatively mapping a subset of the world wide web concerned with a specific issue. It is aimed at building a [corpus](#corpus) of webpages relevant to your inquiry, annotate them and eventually visualize their relations to grasp how the issue is present on the web.

Hyphe browser allows to navigate the web and regroup webpages as [webentities](#webentity) which correspond to the online presence of specific individuals, organizations, etc. relevant to your inquiry.

Hyphe browser allows to qualitatively - and collectively - review and define the [webentities](#webentity) of your inquiry and choose whether they should be included [IN](#in) the corpus or excluded [OUT](#out) of it. When a [webentity](#webentity) is included [IN](#in) the [corpus](#corpus), the Hyphe server automatically navigates to each of its webpages and analyzes their content to discover linked webentities that may be relevant to your inquiry (this is technically called _crawling_).

## How should I work?

A typical workflow with Hyphe browser could look like that:

1.  you define a few websites of individuals, organizations, actors, ... relevant to your inquiry, browse to them with hyphe browser, and include them [IN](#in) the corpus
2.  each webentity included in the corpus will be automatically analyzed (_crawled_) by the hyphe server to discover new possibly relevant webentities and add them to the [SUGGESTIONS](#suggestions) list
3.  you review webentities proposed by the server in the [SUGGESTIONS](#suggestions) list, reading them with the browser and making the choice to include them [IN](#in) the corpus or exclude them [OUT](#out) of the corpus
4.  the 2 previous steps repeat as long as you are not satisfied with the web territory covered by your inquiry
5.  once your corpus is stabilized and your mapping seems comprehensive enough to start analyzing their relations, you can tag your webentities according to different categories and then visualize them as a network in hyphe (top right button)
6.  of course, all of this process is iterative and previous steps can repeat as much as necessary
